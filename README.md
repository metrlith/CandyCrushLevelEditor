# Candy Crush Level Editor

Welcome to the Candy Crush Level Editor! This tool allows you to create and edit custom levels for yourself. It works with the [Candy Crush Web Player](https://github.com/tp-duolingo/CandyCrushWebPlayer) and is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.

## Features

- Create and edit levels
- Save and load levels
- Customize level parameters
- User-friendly interface

## Requirements

Nothing. This tool is a standalone web application that runs in your browser. It does not require any additional software or libraries to be installed. But, you will need to follow the instructions of the Candy Crush Web Player to play the levels you create. I personally do not recommend you to use this website in your mobile device as it is not optimized for mobile devices. You can use it in your mobile device if you want to, but I will not be responsible for any mental damage that you may suffer from using this website in your mobile device.

## How To Use

1. Go to <https://tp-duolingo.github.io/CandyCrushLevelEditor/>
2. Start using it!
3. Export or import levels as needed.
4. Enjoy creating your own Candy Crush levels!

## Note

If you want to fork this project, you will need to fork both repositories: the Candy Crush Level Editor and the Candy Crush Web Player. Additionally, please ensure you have the same version of the Candy Crush Web Player as the one used in this project. The Candy Crush Level Editor is designed to work with the latest version of the Candy Crush Web Player, so if you are using an older version, some features may not work as expected.
