## Getting Started
Candy Crush Level Editor relies on Adobe Flash Player, which was discontinued in December 2020. However, you can still download it from archived sources. Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites
To run the Candy Crush Level Editor, you will need to manually download and set up the following:

- **[WaterFox Classic](https://www.waterfox.net/)**: A fork of Firefox that supports Flash Player.
- **[Flash Player](https://archive.org/details/flashplayerarchive)**: The plugin required to run Flash content in the browser.

#### Steps to Set Up Prerequisites:
1. Download both WaterFox Classic and Flash Player from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Lak8T5QbOa9KDT1qW6n3RSEVG3P5F_O?usp=sharing).
2. Install WaterFox Classic by running the installer.
3. Open the Flash Player installer. When prompted for update preferences, select **"Never check for updates"** to prevent Flash from being disabled.
4. Launch WaterFox Classic and choose **"Don't import anything"** unless you plan to use it as your primary browser.
5. If the browser prompts you to allow Flash, click **"Allow and remember"** to enable it for future use. Otherwise, you will be prompted automatically every time you try using the Editor.
