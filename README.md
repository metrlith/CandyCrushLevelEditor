## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start creating your own Candy Crush levels:

1. Set up your environment by following the [Requirements](#requirements) section.
2. Visit the [Candy Crush Level Editor](https://metrlith.github.io/CandyCrushLevelEditor/).
3. Start creating, importing, or exporting levels.
4. Play your custom levels using the [Candy Crush Web Player](https://github.com/metrlith/CandyCrushWebPlayer).

## Requirements

This tool is a standalone web application that runs in your browser. To play the levels you create, you will need to set up the following:

1. **WaterFox Browser**  
   A browser that supports Flash Player, required for running the Candy Crush Web Player. I've tested a lot of browsers myself and found that WaterFox is the best option. It has a built-in Flash Player and is compatible with the Candy Crush Web Player.

2. **Flash Player**  
   Flash is required to play the levels. Note: Flash is deprecated and may pose security risks. Use it at your own discretion.

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Download WaterFox and Flash**  
   Visit [this MediaFire mirror](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/y4nh28s0yuy0o/WaterFox_%26_Flash_Installers) to download the WaterFox and Flash installers.

2. **Install WaterFox**  
   - Run the WaterFox installer.  
   - During installation, choose **not to import anything** if you don't plan on using it as your main browser.

3. **Install Flash**  
   - Run the Flash installer.  
   - Disable automatic updates to prevent Flash from self-destructing.

4. **Enable Flash in WaterFox**  
   - Open WaterFox and type `about:config` in the address bar.  
   - Search for `plugin.state.flash` and set its value to `2` to enable Flash.  
   - (Optional) Set `plugin.state.flash` to `1` to disable Flash later.

## How To Use

1. Go to <https://metrlith.github.io/CandyCrushLevelEditor/>.
2. Use the interface to create your level. Customize parameters such as grid size, candy types, and objectives.
3. Import or export levels as needed:
   - **Import**: Click the "Import" button and upload a level from a JSON text.
   - **Export**: Click the "Export" button to save your design as a JSON text.
4. Play your custom levels using the [Candy Crush Web Player](https://github.com/metrlith/CandyCrushWebPlayer).
5. Save your progress locally to continue editing later.

## Known Issues

- Flash Player is deprecated and may not work on some systems.
- The tool is not compatible with mobile devices.
- Some features may not work as expected in non-WaterFox browsers. Most likely it won't work at all.
